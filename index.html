            <h3>Does it have a purpose?</h3>
            <p>In many peoples opinion "The Stairs to Nowhere has both funtional and symbolic purpose. Symbolically it can represent the ups and downs of live but no matter what you can reach the other side. Funtionally, it is a great place to study, hang with friends, and depending on the season, just sit in the sun.  </p>

            <h3>Why I find It Interesting</h3>
            <p>When I visited the sculpture to gather inspiration, I found it very mysterious considering the courtyard it is in, has no other scultpures to take you attention away from the stairs. It was raining so of course no one was on it and being new to the school I was not even sure I could go on it.</p>
